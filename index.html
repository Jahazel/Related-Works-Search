      <h2>State-of-the-Art</h2>
      <p>
        The latest AI-powered accessibility tools include wearable devices for
        real-time recognition, OCR-based systems for text extraction, and
        AI-driven solutions for digital document accessibility. While effective,
        many require specialized hardware or struggle with complex layouts. Our
        project aims to improve accessibility with a web-based solution that
        integrates both text and visual context without requiring additional
        devices.
      </p>

      <h2>Project Differentiation</h2>
      <p>
        Unlike existing technologies, our project focuses on creating a flexible
        web-based tool that processes various document types—including PDFs,
        handwritten text, and images—and converts them into speech. By avoiding
        specialized hardware, our approach ensures broader accessibility.
        Additionally, our system goes beyond text extraction by incorporating
        visual layout descriptions to enhance comprehension for low-vision
        users.
